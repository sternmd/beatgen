               <em>Collected Poems 1947-1980</em> includes all writings in the groundbreaking paperback volumes published by City Lights Books, the contents of many rare pamphlets issued by small presses, and, finally, some notable texts hitherto unpublishedâ€”one, "Many Loves," - an erotic rhapsody dating from the historic "San Francisco Renaissance" era.

               The uninterrupted energy of Ginsberg's remarkable career is clearly revealed in this collection. Included here are all the poems from the earlier volume Collected Poems 1947-1980, and from Ginsberg's subsequent and final three books of new poetry: <em>White Shroud</em>, <em>Cosmopolitan Greetings</em>, and <em>Death & Fame</em>.

               Half a century after "founding" the Beat Generation, Allen Ginsberg has written this powerful collection of poems that are suffused with a range of emotional colors that gives Ginsberg's work an elegiac tone.

                <em>The Fall of America</em> is more overtly political than most of his previous poetry with many of the poems about Ginsberg's condemnation of America's actions in Vietnam. It is characterized by a prophetic tone inspired by William Blake and Walt Whitman, as well as an objective view characterized by William Carlos Williams.

                <em>Plutonian Ode</em> is a poem collection against the arms race and nuclear armament of the superpowers. It is heavily inspired by Gnosticism which Ginsberg came to know after reading Hans Jonas's book on the subject. Philip Glass' Symphony No. 6 is based on and includes parts of this poem.

                This book of poetry is dedicated to friend and fellow Beat poet Gregory Corso. Despite Ginsberg's feeling that this collection was not his most significant, the poems still represent Ginsberg at a peak period of his craft.
